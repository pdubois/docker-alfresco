This docker-alfresco project is specifically for running an Alfresco with a DB
for internal testing purposes. It is not meant to be used by third parties;
see the upstream project https://github.com/pdubois/docker-alfresco for that.

For a generic Alfresco deployment toolset, see https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-spk.
